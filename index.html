  <h1>Conway's Game of Life</h1>
  <p>Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton developed in 1970 by John Conway.
    Cells can be set "dead" or "alive" at the beginning. Subsequent generations are
    determined based on a set of fixed rules. More information on rules and starting patterns
    can be found on <a href = "http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/Main_Page"> LifeWiki </a></p>

  <p>This is my original version of Conway's Game of Life. Grids can be initialized to any size,
  and live and dead cells are set based on x, y coordinates with (0,0) on the top left. Each
  subsequent generation is printed out into the console. The source code can be found
  <a href = "https://github.com/jocelynjyl/GameOfLife"> here</a>.</p>

  <p> An updated version of Conway's Game of Life which has a GUI can be found
